This project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of chest disease diagnosis through the use of deep learning models. The project compares the performance of various state-of-the-art architectures, including Vision Transformers, InceptionNetV3, EfficientNetV2, MobileNetV2, NasnetMobile, ConvNext, and DenseNet169, on the Chest-Xray-14 dataset.

The dataset contains a total of 15,000 chest X-ray images, which are classified into three categories: normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19. The project provides a thorough overview of the methods and models used, along with an extensive analysis of the results. The findings demonstrate the potential of these models in improving early diagnosis and treatment of chest diseases, offering great promise for enhancing healthcare system efficiency and patient care.

To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip.
3. Download the Chest-Xray-14 dataset and place it in the data folder.
4. Run the Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate the models.
